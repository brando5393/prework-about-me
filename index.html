      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have been dedicated to studying I.T. for the last 7+ years in the areas of networking and security. However, I have always had a passion for coding in particular. My first exposure to coding took place when I was in middle school and taught myself the previous versions of HTML and CSS. My personal goals for this bootcamp are, to have fun learning new things, expand and hone previous skills and come out with the skills and tools needed to start a career as a developer. I look forward to working with you.</p>
